Hi.

I'm writing to send you the  results for the hbnc2h structure. I made the final graphs just few minutes ago.

All the results are totally converged with the following parameters:
    vacuum = 11.216459551 angstroms (equivalent to have a z lenght of 14Angs less the height of the structure)
    total number of bands = 36 (18 conduction bands  and 18 valence bands with spin)
    ecut = 40Ha
    kpts = 5002

The responses are the following 
    real and imaginary linear response (chi-hbnc2h_re.pdf and chi-hbnc2h_im.pdf),   
    degree of spin polarization (dsp-hbnc2h.pdf), 
    optical current injection (eta-hbnc2h.pdf)

Is important to mention that this structure is not good to reach a large DSP. The best case is along the z direction and is less than 2%. For the  optical current injection we have that the z component is equal to zero.

If you have any sugestion for changes just let me know.

Thanks.
